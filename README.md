# EtherLotto
Ethereum blockchain based lottery.

## Rationale

Blockchains are deterministic so it's difficult to provide a secure random source, but it's possible using some bridge between the Bitcoin blockchain & Ethereum smart contracts so instead using Ethereum block time, an automated lottery game can use higher block exchange rate from Bitcoin's blockchain increasing the entropy quality.
